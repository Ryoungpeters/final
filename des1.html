    <h2>Destination Information</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
        Paris is a city packed with character, history, and instantly recognizable scenery. Areas like Île de la Cité and the Marais show off the city’s older architecture, while places near the Louvre Museum highlight its huge artistic influence. Each neighborhood feels different — the quiet café streets in Saint-Germain, the open boulevards rebuilt during Haussmann’s redesign, and the classy residential areas around the 7th arrondissement. Paris blends its past and present in a way that makes exploring feel effortless and exciting.

    <h2>Travel Tips & Logistics</h2>
    <p class="section-text">
        Getting around Paris is simple thanks to the Paris Métro, which connects most major spots, including areas near the Eiffel Tower and Montmartre. A lot of big attractions, like the Musée d'Orsay, use timed tickets, so booking ahead saves you from long lines. Paris is extremely walkable, so comfortable shoes matter more than you’d think. Even knowing a couple basic French phrases goes a long way toward smoother interactions.

Whether you’re visiting a museum, walking along the river, or just getting lost in a new neighborhood, Paris makes everyday exploring feel memorable.
