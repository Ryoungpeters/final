    <p class="section-text">
        Getting around Paris is actually really simple. The metro is fast, cheap, and takes you
        almost anywhere you want to go. A lot of major attractions offer timed tickets, so booking
        ahead can save you a long wait in line. Paris is very walkable, so comfortable shoes help a
        lot. Even knowing a few basic French phrases can make your trip smoother and more enjoyable.
