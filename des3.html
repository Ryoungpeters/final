        <h2>Destination Information</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Switzerland is known for its clean cities, mountain views, and some of the most impressive landscapes in Europe. Places like Zürich offer a mix of modern life, lakeside scenery, and historic old-town streets, while areas such as Lucerne feel more traditional with their wooden bridges and mountain backdrop. The Swiss Alps are a huge part of the country’s identity, and regions near the Matterhorn or the Jungfraujoch show why travelers come here for the views alone. Everywhere you go, Switzerland has a calm and organized feel that makes exploring easy and enjoyable.

        <h2>Travel Tips & Logistics</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Switzerland has one of the most reliable public transportation systems in the world. Trains connect major cities like Zürich, Lucerne, and Geneva with scenic mountain towns, and they run on time almost every time. If you plan to travel a lot, rail passes can save money and make hopping between destinations simple. Switzerland is generally more expensive than other European countries, so budgeting for food and activities helps. Most people speak English well, especially in tourist areas, which makes navigating the country straightforward even if you don’t know German, French, or Italian.
