        <h2>Destination Information</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Iceland is a place that feels almost unreal with its mix of waterfalls, volcanoes, black-sand beaches, and quiet open landscapes. The capital city, Reykjavík, blends colorful buildings with a calm coastal atmosphere, and it’s usually the starting point for exploring the rest of the country. Many visitors follow the classic Golden Circle route, which includes stops like Þingvellir National Park and the powerful waterfall at Gullfoss. Iceland’s scenery changes quickly from area to area, which makes even short drives feel like part of the adventure.

        <h2>Travel Tips & Logistics</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
            Iceland is easy to navigate whether you’re renting a car or taking guided tours. Roads are well-marked, but weather can change fast, so checking conditions before heading out is a must. Popular spots like the Blue Lagoon require reservations, especially during peak seasons. Food and gas tend to be more expensive than in other countries, so planning ahead helps. Even though Iceland is remote, English is widely spoken, making communication simple for travelers.
